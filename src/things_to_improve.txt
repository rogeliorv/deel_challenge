Things to improve in current application:

- Change the profileId to UUID instead of incremental numeric
- Add Sentry or some other tool for error monitoring
- Add decorators to middleware and controllers+routes to make easier to read
- Add typescript to the solution and change everything to ES6
- Add a lock to deposit in case two processes try to deposit at the same time
- Reset DB per test (slower but makes tests non dependent on other changes)
