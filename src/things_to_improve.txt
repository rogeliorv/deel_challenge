Things not required that were improved:

- Added routers instead of having everything under app



Things to improve in current application:

- Change the profileId to UUID instead of incremental numeric
- Add something like Sentry to monitor errors
- Add decorators to middleware to make easier to read
- Add typescript to the solution and change everything to ES6
